### Auto import Production DB data

Due to this functionality whenever the developer runs migration related commands 

i.e. `php artisan migrate` 

then first the old production database schema will populate along with existing data. Then the internal custom migrations  will process


>Note: There is no need to intensionally upload existed database.
